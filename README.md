# AI-Powered_University_Course_Advisor_Chatbot_
In this project I developed an AI-powered course advisor chatbot for Teesside University UK using open-source tools. The chatbot provides real-time, document-grounded academic support by retrieving course and policy information from institutional documents through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework.

Teesside University, established in 1987, is a forward-thinking institution with over 25,000
students. To enhance academic services and reduce manual workload, the university aims
to implement an open-source AI chatbot that provides 24/7 student support.
